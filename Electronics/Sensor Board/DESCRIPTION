<b>Sensor Board for Smart Cane</b>
<p>
This sensor board connect 2 force sensor resistors (FSR) to a MCU using a current to voltage converter for each sensor. This signal are added using an operational amplifier in a non-inverter added configuration. These sensors are supplied at -3.3V through a charger pump. This board is supplied at +3.3V.
