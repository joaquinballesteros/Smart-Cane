Smart-cane is an open hardware and open software project created to promoting an active ageing. This project was created on [Integrated Systems Engineering group](www.grupoisis.uma.es/), on Department of Electronic Technology (Málaga University). Nowadays, it is carried out at MDH University at the [Biomedical Engineering group](http://www.es.mdh.se/research-groups/32-Biomedical_Engineering) in collaboration with [Integrated Systems Engineering group](www.grupoisis.uma.es/).

The project is led by [Dr. Ballesteros](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joaquin_Ballesteros) and it counts with the help of [M.Sc. Alberto Tudela](https://duma.uma.es/duma/buscador/persona/535571bb-1da1-4cbd-a49a-7b0d61c4cd2d/), [B.Sc. Juan Caro](https://duma.uma.es/duma/buscador/persona/6eeb9474-2ce9-4c46-8f6d-ff7827abb2c9/) and the support of [Prof. Dr. Maria Lindén](http://www.es.mdh.se/staff/114-Maria_Lind__n) and [Prof. Dr. Cristina Urdiales](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cristina_Urdiales2).

This project is focused on adding on-board sensors to the cane to monitor users. These sensors should be affordable in order to reduce the cost and to increase the number of end users. Force sensors and hall effect sensors are being testing to measure the weight-bearing and other significant parameters related with an active ageing. The results are been validated in collaboration with the following Senior centres (Centros de participación activa) in Córdoba (Spain): CÓRDOBA II, FUENSANTA – CAÑERO, PONIENTE, LOS NARANJOS.


## Built With
* [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) - The program used to to design the plastic pieces. All these documents have been exported to STEP file extension too. It is an ISO standard exchange format that can be openned by other programs, such as [FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD).

* [MBED online compiler](https://os.mbed.com/handbook/mbed-Compiler) - The online program used to to programming the BLE Nano v1 microcontroller. 

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) - The program to create the mobile software.
